# Welcome to my GitHub page!

I’m a data scientist with 3+ years of experience and a Ph.D. in Geophysics. In this document, I will showcase some of the projects I’ve worked on and the skills I’ve acquired along the way.

## About me
My passion for data science stems from my curiosity about the natural phenomena that shape our planet and the data that can help us comprehend them better. That’s why I obtained a Ph.D. in geophysics, where I investigated seismic waves and their interactions with the Earth’s structure. I utilized Python and MATLAB to process and examine large datasets of seismic recordings from around the world. As a researcher, I authored three peer-reviewed publications in reputable journals.

After completing my degree, I joined a leading seismological observatory as a researcher (University of Utah Seismograph Stations), where I continued to work on seismic data analysis and earthquake magnitude modeling. I cooperated with other scientists from the USGS, AFRL, LLNL, and other institutions to enhance our understanding of earthquake hazards and risks.

I then decided to switch gears and explore other domains where data science can make an impact. I joined Bayer crop sciences as a data scientist, where I worked on models that forecast corn seed yield given historic growth and other agronomic factors. I used Python, SQL, and Domino to manipulate and explore large datasets of crop measurements, weather data, soil data, and satellite imagery. I constructed the predictive models using scikit-learn.

My most recent position was working as a Data Scientist at Coyote Logistics, which is a 3PL service provider where I work on sophisticated predictive models that estimate potential distributions of market cost for a given load of freight. I use Python, SQL (and noSQL), and Databricks to ingest and transform data from various sources such as carriers, shippers, brokers, and third-party APIs. I also use LightGBM, scikit-learn, and PyTorch to build and fit models that capture the uncertainty and variability of the freight market.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on or I'm currently working on:

- **Earthquake Magnitude Estimation**: Created physics-informed empirical models of amplitude decay over distance via non-parametric inversions, pre-conditioned using events with known earthquake magnitudes. This method was applied for both Local (Richter), and Moment Magnitudes estimations, with the latter focusing on small magnitude estimation, which is difficult to obtain via conventional physical modeling. This work resulted in two peer-reviewed publications which were published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, and Seismological Research Letters.
- **Corn Yield Prediction**: Created new and improved existing random forest models to predict corn seed yield across the world, leveraging multi-year spanning historic yields, and agronomic features (e.g., weather conditions, soil conditions, field clusters defined using remote sensing data, etc.).
- **Freight Market Cost Distribution**: Used a combination of Random Forest and LightGBM models to predict a potential cost distributions around the price to move certain freight to and from distribution centers across the USA. The models use proprietary in-house data to generate a prediction.
